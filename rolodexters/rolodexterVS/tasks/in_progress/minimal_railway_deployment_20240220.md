## Context

Need to deploy a minimal working version of toys to Railway ASAP to explore default UI/UX functionality.

## Immediate Actions (Minimal Path)

1. Basic Setup
   - [ ] Fork/clone toys repository
   - [ ] Create Railway account if not exists
   - [ ] Install Railway CLI

   ```sh
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. Quick Deploy Steps
   - [ ] Login to Railway

   railway login
   ```

   - [ ] Initialize project

   ```sh
   railway init
   ```

   - [ ] Link repository

   ```sh
   railway link
   ```

3. Essential Environment Variables
   - [ ] Set only critical env vars

   ```sh
   railway variables set DATABASE_URL=<value>
   railway variables set API_KEY=<value>
   ```

4. Deploy

   ```sh
   railway up
   ```

## Critical Files Needed

## Skip For Now

- Complex configurations
- Advanced monitoring
- Custom domain setup
- Performance optimization
- Extended testing

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Application starts
- [ ] Basic UI is accessible
- [ ] Can access default features

## Troubleshooting

If deploy fails:

1. Check Railway logs

   ```sh
   railway logs
   ```

2. Verify build process
3. Check for missing critical env vars

## Next Steps After Success

1. Document working configuration
2. Note any immediate issues
