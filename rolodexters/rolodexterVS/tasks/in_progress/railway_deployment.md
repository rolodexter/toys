## Status
In Progress - Debugging Health Check Issues

## Latest Updates (2025-02-20)
1. Enhanced Startup Logging
   - Added comprehensive logging to start.sh
   - Added process monitoring
   - Added file existence checks
   - Enabled gunicorn debug logging

2. Improved Flask Configuration
   - Added detailed logging configuration
   - Added error handling and reporting
   - Enhanced health check implementation

3. Service Connections
   - Configured shared variables across services
   - Updated Redis and PostgreSQL configurations
   - Implemented proper variable references

## Services Setup
1. Main Application Service (toys)
   - Connected to GitHub repo: rolodexter/toys
   - Branch: main
   - Using Dockerfile for build
   - Serverless deployment enabled
   - Health check path: /health
   - Enhanced logging and monitoring

2. PostgreSQL Service (toys-postgres)
   - Using shared variables for configuration
   - Connection pooling enabled
   - Health check implemented

3. Redis Service (toys-redis)
   - Using shared variables for configuration
   - SSL enabled
   - Health check implemented
   - Support for both naming conventions (REDIS_HOST/REDISHOST)

## Configuration Files
1. railway.toml
   - Updated to use shared variables
   - Configured service connections
   - Added Railway system variables

2. Dockerfile
   - Multi-stage build (Node.js and Python)
   - PostgreSQL development dependencies
   - Redis support

3. Flask Configurations
   - Database config (configs/database.py)
   - Redis config (configs/redis.py)
   - App config (configs/app_config.py)
   - Health check module (health.py)

4. Start Script
   - Enhanced start.sh with logging
   - Process monitoring
   - Error handling

## Current Issues
1. Health Check Failing
   - Added comprehensive logging
   - Monitoring process status
   - Checking file existence
   - Verifying service connections

## Next Steps
1. Monitor enhanced logs for startup issues
2. Verify service connections
3. Test database and Redis health checks
4. Configure auto-scaling rules

## Notes
- Using Railway's internal network for service communication
- SSL enabled for Redis connections
- Connection pooling configured for PostgreSQL
- Environment variables shared across services
- Enhanced logging for debugging
